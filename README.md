# Cpp
Coin Sorter Machine Project

This is a project that is coded to take in coins related data like weight and diameter of the coin, then output the usability of the coins and sort them into their respective categories for wrapping.

This is a first-year computer science for engineers project, where students are expected to demonstrate understanding of creating functions, INPUT/OUTPUT routes, memory allocations, data input manipulations as well as the skill to debug when necessary.
The project is also free-binding in which students can code in ways they understand the problem and use any style of executing the program with the restriction that the source code file must be in .CPP. 


This project is coded in Visual Studio 2019 using C/C++ (primarily C++).
